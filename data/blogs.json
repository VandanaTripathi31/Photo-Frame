    "content": "Photo frames are more than just décor—they tell stories. From minimalistic black frames that bring elegance to your living room, to colorful collage frames that capture memories in one place, the trend is shifting towards personalization. Modern buyers prefer LED-lit frames and rustic wooden styles to match their interiors. Creative placement, such as a gallery wall or a theme-based arrangement, transforms ordinary walls into personal museums."

    "content": "Choosing the right frame can completely change how your photo looks. For family portraits, wooden frames create warmth. For modern artwork, sleek metal or glass frames work best. Collage frames are perfect for capturing a timeline of memories, while engraved plaques make ideal gifts. Always consider the wall color, photo theme, and frame durability before making your choice."
